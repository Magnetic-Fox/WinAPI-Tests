# WinAPI Tests

This repository contains my first real experiments with programing whole program using 16-bit Windows API.

## Important note
**This repository contains very simple experiments only!** If You like to see something more advanced (at least a bit), take a look at my much bigger project called [SimpleNoter](https://github.com/Magnetic-Fox/SimpleNoter). I think it's much more representative. ;)

## What is included in this repo?

Simple C++ project, being experiment with 16-bit Windows API made to understand how to create simple Windows applications without any Rapid Application Development IDEs such as Delphi, Lazarus or Visual Studio.
And 16-bit, because I always wanted to create some programs for Windows 3.11 without Delphi 1 (so in different language than Pascal). ;-)

## What to use to compile this code?

The code provided here was made to compile using Open Watcom IDE, which is quite good for modern MS-DOS/WfW3.11 development.
It's possible that it would compile using old Microsoft compilers, but I haven't tested it. It's best to use Watcom for it.

## Disclaimer

I've made much effort to provide here working and checked codes with hope it will be useful.
